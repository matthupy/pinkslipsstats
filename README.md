### About

Pink Slips is the high-octane storyline driven Madden Franchise pioneered by [C4](https://www.youtube.com/@C4YouTube). 

## Contribution

Main content is located within https://github.com/matthupy/pinkslipsstats/tree/main/content/en/episodes. Any changes needed to be made to an episode will be done there, the episode number correlates to the filename: `content/en/episodes/{number}.md`.

I am looking for help getting in some of the episode results. If you are able to provide info about either for a episode please provide a timestamp so I can easily verify.

You can either submit any help as a PR or a issue with this [form](https://github.com/matthupy/pinkslipsstats/issues/new?assignees=&labels=episode&template=EPISODE-STAT.yml&title=%5BEpisode+Statistic%5D) 

> For Example: Game stats start at 34:00 on Season 2 Episode 45

### Installing

`main` is the primary branch. When making feature or bugfix branches you should start with checking out main branch and creating your new branch based from it.
